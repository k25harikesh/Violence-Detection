# Violence Detector using Mobilenet_v2 Pre-trained Model (CNN+LSTM)

## Overview
This project implements a violence detector using a Mobilenet_v2 pre-trained model combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The Mobilenet_v2 model is used for feature extraction from video frames, and the LSTM network is used to analyze temporal sequences of features to detect violence in videos.

## Features
- Utilizes transfer learning with Mobilenet_v2 pre-trained model for feature extraction.
- Implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for analyzing temporal sequences of features.
- Trained on custom data to detect violence in videos.
- Provides specific results for violence detection in videos.


## Dependencies
